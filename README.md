# maps
- **Classroom**: to evoke a map of the world in a classroom, I styled the [Mapbox Countries v1 tileset](https://docs.mapbox.com/vector-tiles/reference/mapbox-countries-v1/) with the [Data Visualization component](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/create-a-map-with-data-visualization-component/) (filtering non-US worldviews & using `color_group` numbers) and added the ability to draw lines and polygons on the map with [Mapbox GL Draw](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-draw/blob/main/docs/API.md).
- **Impression, NYC**: a smattering of maps, including a [storytelling map](https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling), combining processed [2017 NYC LiDAR Capture](https://maps.nyc.gov/lidar/2017/) data hosted on [Cesium](https://cesium.com/blog/2019/11/06/cesium-uber/) and rendered with [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/examples/tile-3d-layer/) and [loaders.gl](https://loaders.gl/examples/3d-tiles).
- **Mapbox Imagery in 2020**: a [storytelling map](https://github.com/mapbox/storytelling) of 14 Updates to Mapbox Satellite in 2020.
- **Borderline: 49Â°N**: a [Mapbox GL Director](https://developmentseed.org/gl-director/) animation along the straight part of the Canada-United States border.
